=head1 NAME

Bio::Otter::Log::Log4perl - wrapper on Log::Log4perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Using this as a direct replacement for L<Log::Log4perl> prevents both

=over 2

=item 1. Log4perl: Seems like no initialization happened. Forgot to call init()?

=item 2. Suppression of log output, until initialisation is done.

=back

by doing an implicit init when necessary.
