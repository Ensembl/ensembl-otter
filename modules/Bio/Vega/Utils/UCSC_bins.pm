=head1 NAME - Bio::Vega::Utils::UCSC_bins

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The UCSC binning scheme can be thought of as a kind of hashing algorithm,
whereby all coordinates within the same 128K (2^17) get the same number. The
idea is to create a small index that will return all overlapping features with
the range used by a typical chromsome - start - end query.

This is base on benchmarking work by Any Yates:

  See: https://gist.github.com/andrewyatz/cb318b06b1a5e0533078

I've put numbers in the code rather than using variables because I think it is
clearer, and the numbers should be inlined as constants for speed.

=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

Note that the start is expected to be in UCSC 0-based coordinates, so the
examples take 1 away from it:

  my $bin = smallest_bin_for_range($start - 1, $end);

Used when indexing a feature.

  my $bins_ref = all_bins_overlapping_range($start - 1, $end);

Return a list ref of all the bins needed in a query for fetching features
overlapping a range.

  my $string = all_bins_overlapping_range_string_for_sql($start - 1, $end);

Return a comma separated string of all bins needed in a query for fetching features.
