=head1 NAME

Bio::Vega::SliceLockBroker - manage a SliceLock

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $br = Bio::Vega::SliceLockBroker->new
    (-hostname => $h, -author => $a);
  my $l = $br->lock_create_for_Slice(-slice => $slice);
  ...; # XXX: workflow here
  $br->unlock($a);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Management of SliceLocks (aka. chromosome range locks) in a package
similar to the old L<Bio::Vega::ContigLock>s.

The plan is to put the relevant lock(s) you hold into this box, then
ask it to do operations on the locked regions.  Locks (plural) allows
this code to manage movement between chromosomes in one transaction.

SliceLocks must be created and locked, and then during the transaction
must also be C<bump_activity>d.  It is not enough to just have a
"locked" one sitting in the table while storing other objects, as it
was with L<Bio::Vega::ContigLock>s.

=head2 Comparison with ContigLockBroker

SliceLocks can cover an arbitrary range of any seq_region (normally a
chromosome).  They are persistent after they have been used and
unlocked, leaving an foreign-key-able indication that "something
happened" in that region.

The mapping from ContigLockBroker methods is

=over 4

=item new

SliceLockBroker must be construct or configured with something that
tells the database.  It also has one author and hostname.

=item check_locks_exist_by_slice, check_slice_argument

During L</exclusive_work>, use L</assert_bumped> to ensure that the
region you will operate upon is actually locked.

=item check_no_locks_exist_by_slice

Not implemented; nothing calls it.

=item lock_clones_by_slice

L</lock_create_for_Slice> and then use L</exclusive_work> to wrap the
work+commit.

=item lock_by_object

Pass all the objects at once to L</lock_create_for_objects>, then
continue as for C<lock_clones_by_slice>.

=item remove_by_object, remove_by_slice

Locks created may be unlocked individually via the adaptor.

If you want to unlock everything put into the broker,
L</exclusive_work> can do that as it finishes.

=back

Unlike the ContigLock, it is not enough to have the SliceLock in the
database.  We want to be assured that no other process is operating
under the cover of that same row in the C<slice_lock> table!

The L<Bio::Vega::DBSQL::SliceLockAdaptor/bump_activity> method does
this, and is wrapped up with error catching, COMMIT and ROLLBACK in
the L</exclusive_work> method.


=head1 CAVEATS

=over 4

=item One database

If you need to commit to two databases at once, SliceLockBroker will
need teaching to understand which COMMIT operates where and how to
approximate a two-phase commit.

=item Objects fetched before locks start

SliceLockBroker currently offers no method to refresh or reload the
objects; L</lock_create_for_objects> locks created are not yet "held"
but still "pre"; L</foreach_object> is cast in terms of objects
already loaded.

It is possible for these objects to change between the "load" and lock
acquisition.  It would also be possible for callers of SliceLockBroker
to prevent this, but most (so far) do not bother.

Scripts performing bulk updates on objects loaded before locking are
protected from long-duration locks held by the GUI, but there remains
a (vanishingly small) possibility of edit collisions between scripts.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(-hostname => $h, -author => $a, -adaptor => $dba, -locks => $bvsl, -lockid => $bvsl_id)

Instantiate with any of host, author and/or locks.  Before work is
done, a lock must be provided by any of the various methods.

To fetch L<Bio::Vega::SliceLock>s by their C<slice_lock_id>s, the
broker must be tied to a database via
L<Bio::Vega::DBSQL::AuthorAdaptor> or
L<Bio::Vega::DBSQL::SliceLockAdaptor>.

C<$bvsl> and C<$bvsl_id> may be given as scalar (object or dbID
respectively), or arrayref of such.

=head2 hostname

=head2 client_hostname

Acessor for hostname string.

Error on setting a mismatched hostname, or trying to fetch before it
is known.

=head2 adaptor

Accessor for the L<Bio::Vega::DBSQL::SliceLockAdaptor>.  May be set
explicitly as any DatabaseAdaptor that can provide one, or will be
inferred from any stored lock or author.

Error on setting a mismatched one, or trying to fetch it before it is
known.

=head2 author

Acessor for L<Bio::Vega::Author> object.

Error on setting a mismatched one, or trying to fetch it before it is
known.

For convenience, this may be set as the string C<for_uid> to infer the
author from the process UID.  The L</adaptor> must have been set
already.

Accessor for L<Bio::Vega::SliceLock> objects.  When adding
@more_locks, L</adaptor> will be used to store any which need it.

Error if the new locks have mismatched adaptor, hostname or author.
Otherwise adds the new locks.

Returns list (or count, in scalar context) of the broker's locks.
These locks will have been C<store>d, but no checking is done for the
read phase of this method: there may be no locks, or the ones returned
may no longer be in the database.

=head2 locks_add_by_dbID(@more_lockid)

Calls L<Bio::Vega::DBSQL::SliceLockAdaptor/fetch_by_dbID> for each id,
then continues as for L</locks>.  Requires L</adaptor> be set.

=head2 lock_create_for_Slice(%arg)

Create and L<Bio::Vega::DBSQL::SliceLockAdaptor/store> for a given
slice.  Hostname and author must have been set already.

C<%arg> is passed to L<Bio::Vega::DBSQL::SliceLockAdaptor/new>.  Only
the slice (or seq_region_{id,start,end}), intent and otter_version
should be given.

If successful, returns the new lock after adding it to the broker.
The C<do_lock> step will happen later in the broker workflow.

This method does not call SQL C<COMMIT>.

=head2 lock_create_for_objects($intent, @obj)

Creates locks to cover all the objects.  Currently it makes one per
seq_region, spanning all given objects on it, without consideration
for any other locks.  I<There is room for improvement in a
backwards-compatible way.>

Returns a list of the new locks made, stored and added to broker.

Every C<@obj> must provide the C<feature_Slice> method, the resulting
slice must have a C<seq_region_id> and all must be in the same
database.

For a convenient interface, this method gives no control over the
C<otter_version> of the created locks.

=head2 exclusive_work($code, $unlock)

Implementation of L<Bio::Vega::DBSQL::SliceLockAdaptor/Workflow>
wrapped up in to operate on the L</locks> given to the broker object.

Will call C<COMMIT> multiple times, via L</adaptor>.

In the case of error it will call C<ROLLBACK>.  Then it will also
L<Bio::EnsEMBL::DBSQL::DBAdaptor/clear_caches>, and attempt to
L<Bio::Vega::DBSQL::SliceLockAdaptor/freshen> each lock to avoid
leaving them in an inconsistent state.  Any part of this tidy-up can
fail.

Will take SliceLocks in the states

=over 4

=item * pre

The call to L<Bio::Vega::DBSQL::SliceLockAdaptor/store> has been made,
so there is an L</adaptor> and L</dbID> - as will be the case for any
lock added to the broker object.

This method calls L<Bio::Vega::DBSQL::SliceLockAdaptor/do_lock> for
you.

Any lock successfully added to the broker will have been stored.

=item * held

Ready to begin an exclusive chunk of work.

=back

and will proceed with the workflow, assuming no errors happen:

=over 4

=item 1. C<COMMIT>

=item 2. all locks reach C<active='held'>

If any cannot be locked, C<ROLLBACK> and error.

=item 3. C<COMMIT>

=item 4. C<bump_activity> on all locks

Also, remember these locks for comparison in L</assert_bumped>.

=item 5. Call $code

Currently with no arguments, ignoring the return value.

This code must not try to modify the state of the locks.

Also the code must not C<COMMIT>.  Instead, call L</exclusive_work>
again.

Rollback is called for you if there is an error.

=item 6. C<COMMIT>

And L<Bio::Vega::DBSQL::DBAdaptor/clear_caches>.

=item 7. If $unlock, then C<unlock> and C<COMMIT> again

=back

Returns nothing if everything was done.  Returns the error message (as
a true value, also sent as a warning) if just the unlock failed.  All
other errors are raised.

Error if called outside L</exclusive_work>.  This method should be

Caveat: this method will incorrectly return false for any slice which
is covered by adjacent locks.  This could be fixed, but YAGNI.

=head2 foreach_object($code, @obj)

Run C<< $code->($obj) foreach @obj >> inside L</exclusive_work> and
with an L</assert_bumped> check before each one.

Can perform the L</exclusive_work> call for you, and passes on the
return value.

May also be called inside L</exclusive_work>, in which case it returns
nothing.  This form makes bulk unlocking easier.

C<@obj> are presumably the same objects that were given to
L</lock_create_for_objects> earlier.

=head2 unlock_all()

Ensure every locks in the broker is C<free>d if possible, then
C<COMMIT> if possible.

It catches all errors, because it is expected to be useful in a "try /
finally" block.  Emits a warning for each error, and returns (purely
FYI) a list of C<[$error, $lock] or [$error]> failure tuples.

Returns nothing for success.
