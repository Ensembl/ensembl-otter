=head1 NAME

Tk::ScopedBusy - Busy out a widget until object is dropped

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $widget = $self->toplevel;
 my $busy = Tk::ScopedBusy->new($widget, -recurse => 1);
 ...
 return; # $busy is forgotten, and the Unbusy happens

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In addition to exception-safe Busy handling, this module will report
various unexpected transitions in the (implicit) state machine for
Busy.
