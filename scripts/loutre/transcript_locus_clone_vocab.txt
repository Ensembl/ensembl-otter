    annotation remarks (not visible in VEGA)

        readthrough
        NMD exception - plus literature ref?
        not organism-supported
        not best-in-genome evidence
        non-submitted evidence
        for experimental confirmation

    - the rest all require a data field:

        upstream_ATG <distance in aa upstream>

        selenocysteine <aa position> [<aa position>]
            - already added, but does not work if you want NMD too!

        CCDS <CCDS ID>
        contains ncRNA <EMBL ACCESSION>

        SNP                     <OTTER EXON STABLE ID>
        genome sequence error   <OTTER EXON STABLE ID>
        non-canonical splicing  <OTTER EXON STABLE ID> <5' or 3' end of exon>
        nagnag splicing         <OTTER EXON STABLE ID> - always 5' end of exon
            - these 4 exon properties can all occur multiple times

        selenoprotein
            - automatically added if it has a selenocysteine containing
              transcript
