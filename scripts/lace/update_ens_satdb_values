=head1 NAME - update_ens_satdb_values

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Automatically updates meta table keys that point to satellite databases on
ens-livemirror by incrementing the schema version part of the name by 1.

Nees to be run in C<ensembl-otter/scripts/lace> because it calls
C<save_satellite_db>, which is safe because that script checks that it can
connect with the new parameters before saving.
