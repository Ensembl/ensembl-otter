attempting to install it.

=head2 Otterlace

Otterlace is an interactive, graphical client, which uses a local acedb
database with Zmap and perl/Tk tools to curate genomic annotation.
Annotation is stored in an extended Ensembl schema (the "otter" database),
which presents the annotator with contiguous regions of a chromosome.  The
acedb database provides local persistent storage, so that if the software or
desktop machine crashes, reboots or is exited, the editing session can be
recovered.  Since all communication goes through the Sanger web server,
annotators can work wherever there is a network connection.
