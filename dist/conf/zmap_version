RELEASE: 0-1-136

# This defines which ZMap version to use.  The install script copies
# ZMap and AceDB binaries from the ZMap build tree into the
# installation directory and uses a copy of the ZMap XRemote source
# directory to build the XRemote Perl module.

#  The valid values are:
#    'DEVELOPMENT':           the current development build
#    'RELEASE: <version>':    the release build of <version>
#    'PRODUCTION: <version>': the production build of <version>
