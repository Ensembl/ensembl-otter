# CASPR3 related. (CNTNAP3). Ref protein Q9BZ76.
# This one is complex, due to the fact that the gene
# is large, there are incomplete copies in the
# tiling path due to gaps, and two diverged
# fragments of the gene appear to have been
# duplicated independently of the whole gene
# duplication events. However, for this reason the
# distribution of these elements could tell us
# something about the evolution of the whole region.
# The genes and gene fragments will be obvious as
# clustered exonic BLAST hits. If you look at the
# distribution of BLAST hits, in addition to whole
# genes or large fragments of the gene at high
# identity (>80%), there will be groups of hits at
# lower identity (50-80% aa) which span the
# following regions of the protein
#
# A: a core of positions 270-746aa (up to 196-746)
# B: a core of positions 849-998aa (up to 849-1074)
#
# In ctg 1007 (NT_078043.4) which starts with AL590491 (RP11-144A16) these map to:
#
# A. 269843-305509 (exons 269943-269953, 270689-270874, 305342-305509)
# B. 507622-511605 (exons 507557-507770, 511605-511766)
#
# Since they have intron/exon structure, they are
# not processed. Blasting these co-ordinates against
# the pericentromeric sequence will identify the
# recently created paralogues of these gene
# fragments, all of which share >95% id at the DNA
# level.
